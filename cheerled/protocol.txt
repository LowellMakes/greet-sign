This protocol is a serial packet system which is formed around sending ASCII text to the LED signs.

= Errors =

 7ê - Some sort of comm error, appears when you screw up the packets

= Packet Format =

Start Message: 00
Sign Address: FF,FF (e.g. All Signs, but irelivent for usb device)
Clear Messages: 00/01 (bool)
[
  SectionType: (see table)
  [Section Options]
  [Section Contents]
  ...
]
End Message: FF,00

== Section Types ==

 0x00 - Initalisation
 0x01 - Set Messages
 0x02 - Set Special File
 0x03 - Unknown or unused
 0x04 - Set Alarm
 0x05 - Set Hourly Alarm
 0x06 - Set Auto On Time
 0x07 - Set Auto Off Time
 0x08 - Set Time
 0x09 - Send User-Defined Images

= Initalisation =

All Messages seem to have a section where all bytes
Between 00 and 7F are sent: (assume start/end message)

Section Type: 0B
Bytes: 00->7F
End Section: FF

= Set Message =

A message can send Text, Images and pre-sets for display into one of 8 files
Each with multiple lines, colours, fonts and other settings:

Section Type: 01
File: 30,31 (i.e. 01)
Set Colour: EF,B0 (see table)
Set Font: EF,A2 (see table)
[Message]
End Frame: FF
Next File: FF,FF,FF

== Message Contents ==

This is how the bytes of a message are understood by the device:

00-19 [0-25]     Animation Instruction (should apear BEFORE ANY Other)
1A-1F [26-31]    ** Unused, no effect
20-7F [32-127]   ASCII Text as expected
80-ED [128-237]  Symbols (66 known symbols out of 109)
EF    [239]      Next byte is Code byte (see table)
F0-FE [240-254]  ** Unused, no effect
FF    [255]      End Frame

=== Special Code Bytes ===

Each special code displays something that isn't text:

00-5F [0-95]     ** Unused, No effect
60-7D [96-125]   Pre-defined Symbols 1-30
7E,7F [126,127]  ** Unused, cause an error
80    [128]      Time
81    [129]      Date
82    [130]      Temperature (°C)
83-8F [131-143]  ** Unused, No effect
90-97 [144-151]  Animated Cartoons 1-8
98-9F [152-159]  Predefined Graphics 1-8
A0-A6 [160-166]  Set Font (See Font map)
A7-AB [167-171]  ** Unused, cause an error
AC-AD [172-173]  Compressed Font (unreadable)
AE    [174]      ** Unused, cause an error
AF    [175]      Remove letter spacing
B0-BF [176-191]  Colours 1-16 (see colour map)
C0-C7 [192-199]  Speeds, Fastest to Slowest
C8-CF [200-207]  Delay between frames (lines: 3,4,5,6,8,16,32 seconds)
D0-D7 [208-215]  Custom Graphic Set 1-8
D8-DF [216-223]  Predefined Graphics 1-8
E0-E9 [224-233]  Sounds (see Sound Map)
EA-EF [234-239]  Beep Errors
F0-FF [240-255]  ** Unused, No effect

= Set Special File =

This packet seems to want to set a file being used during a certain time of the day
8 different times for 8 different files can be selected:

Section Type: 02
Special File Id: 01 (0-9)
Day of the Week: 01-7E (see Week Bitmap)
Start Time: 31,31,31,37 (HHMM)
End Time: 32,31,33,33 (HHMM)
Files to Run: 30,31,30,32 ... (i.e 01,02 ...)

== Week Bitmap ==

The week is laid out as a simple bit mask, 1 means display on this week day:

1, Sunday
2, Monday
4, Tuesday
8, Wednesday
16, Thursday
32, Friday
64, Saturday


= Set Alarm =

These are the settings for the alarm, not the alarm it's self:

Section Type: 04
Alarm Times: 01-99 (number of times to repeat)
Interval: 1E (30) (minutes between each repeat)

== Set Hourly Alarm ==

Section Type: 05
Set the Hourly Alarm On: 00/01 (bool)

== Set Auto On Time ==

Header: 06
Time: 32,32,33,32,33,33 (HHMMSS)

== Set Auto Off Time ==

Section Type: 07
Time: 32,31,30,36,32,32 (HHMMSS)

== Set Time ==

This option is most important, it will reset the time in the device:

Section Type: 08
Unknown: 01
24 Hour Clock: 00/01
Date: 30,39,30,33,30,39 [YYMMDD]
Time: 30,31,31,31,34,35 [HHMMSS]

= Send Image =

The application does not currently work when setting the graphics,
this information is scraped from what logic appears in the packets sent,
but doesn't work yet:

Section Type: 09
Custom Image Id: 00-07
Pixel Data: 280 Bytes (see section)
End: 00, 00

== Pixel Data ==

The pixel data is 280 bytes long and comprises of the following:

 * 7 Rows * 80 Colums
 * Each Byte is a set of 8 pixels
 * Each Row has 10 bytes,
 * Each Mask has 7 Rows (70 Bytes)
 * There are 4 masks per image
 * Each mask when used together produce colours as follows:

0000 Black         0
1000 Dark Red      1
1100 Red           3
0010 Dark Green    4
1010 Dark Yellow   5
1110 Dark Orange   7
0011 Green         12
1011 Orange        13
1111 Yellow        15

So if every pixel is Red you should see 140 bytes of FF followed by 140 bytes of 00.
This works out because the first two masks as all set, and the second two masks are not (i.e Red)
Each mask is 70 bytes big.

Author Note: This does seem rather complex, But this must have evolved from a monochrome system.
